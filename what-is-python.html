    <h1>What is Python?</h1>
    <p>
        Python is a powerful and versatile programming language. 
		It's widely used in various fields, including data science, web development, and automation. 
		It is also a very popular choice for beginners.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>
    <p>
        To begin, you need to install Python on your computer and set up a simple code editor or IDE.
    </p>

    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    <p>
        The first program every programmer writes is "Hello, World!". This simple program introduces you to the basic syntax and how to print text to the screen.
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code class="language-python">
print("Hello, World!")
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Basic Syntax and Data Types</h2>
    <p>
        Python uses simple syntax and indentation to structure code. You'll also learn about basic data types, such as strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>print()</code> function is used for output, and the <code>input()</code> function is used to get user input.
